K-means clustering is a widely-used unsupervised algorithm in machine learning used for dividing a dataset into groups or clusters based on similarities between among data points. Discovering natural groups within data is a technique used in data analysis, pattern recognition, and many fields. The primary objective of K-means clustering is to group similar data points into clusters and reduce variation within each cluster.

The task was completed in Jupyter Notebook using the data in the Country-data.csv file which was loaded into a DataFrame. The data was explored using the info(), describe() and shape functions from the pandas library. Any non-numeric columns, namely 'Country', were dropped. Different scatter plots were plotted with different combinations of continuous variables against GDPP. Using the MinMaxScalar from sklearn, the data set was normalised. The optimal number of was determined using the elbow and silhouette score of the model and the scaled data was fitted to this number of clusters. The clusters for the Child mortality vs GDPP and Inflation groups were visualised. The groups of countries in the plots created prior based on child mortality, GDPP and inflation were labelled and justified.
